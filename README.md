# Mobile Coding Challenge
The goal of this challenge is to give you an opportunity to show us what you know and how you would work in a real life project.

## Introduction
Your local movie theater wants to make things a bit more interesting to attract the younger audience.

To do this, they came up with the idea of building a mobile application so users can see which movies are available to watch, leave reviews, build a community, etc.

They have commended you with the task of building such app. Since it's a first version to test if it's a good product or not, they have chosen a few features to build first and then see what happens.

Since they don't have a backend service, the first version of the application will be built using the public api https://developers.themoviedb.org/3

## Features
The key features of the application will be:

### 1. Discover
After opening the app, users should be able to see a list of movies suggested by the app sorted by popularity.

- API endpoint: https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/discover/movie-discover
- Design reference (available on assets folder):

### 2. Movie details
Users should be able to access the details of the movies displayed on the discover section.

- API endpoint: https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/movies/get-movie-details
- Design reference (available on assets folder):

### 3. Movie reviews
Users should be able to see a list of user reviews for a specific movie.

- API endpoint: https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/movies/get-movie-reviews
- Design reference (available on assets folder):

- The project's codebase delivered somehow (you pick).

## FAQ
- Do I need to add tests?
  - Tests are not mandatory, test what you consider important.
- Do I need to follow the designs?
  - The provided designs are just a guideline to give you a reference. Feel free to build the UI as you like.
- Do I need to use some specific libraries?
  - No, build the app with the tools you prefer, there are no limits.
- I'm doing the challenge on react-native, does it need to support both platforms?
